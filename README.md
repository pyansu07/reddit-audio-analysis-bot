# Reddit Audio Analysis Bot (Prototype)

This project is a prototype Reddit bot built for experimentation and development purposes.

## Purpose
The bot responds only to explicit user commands (e.g. `!analyzeAudio`) in specific AI/media-related subreddits.
It processes user-provided audio or media links and returns basic analysis results in-thread.

## Features (Planned)
- User-triggered interactions only
- Audio/media analysis via external processing pipeline
- Clear, non-intrusive replies
- Full compliance with Reddit API policies and subreddit rules

## Status
Early-stage prototype. API integration and workflows are under active development.
